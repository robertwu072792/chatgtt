# HANDOFF - Swing or Get Swung

Living snapshot, read first, update at end of session.

## What this is

**The game is called Swing or Get Swung.**
The home-screen label under the app icon is the short form **SOGS**, because iOS truncates a long name there.
**Nuclear Rush is the name of the game mode**, not the game. Do not conflate the two.

It is a Godot 4.7 mobile 4v4 objective FPS, landscape only, built for iOS.
Earlier names for the same project: Riftline, WhoYouPeekin, Nuclear Rush.

The bundle id is still `com.lull.riftline` and is deliberately unchanged, because changing it breaks code signing and orphans existing installs.
That is a separate decision from the display name.

This repo is protected on `main` - land changes by branch + PR, not a direct push (`gh pr merge --admin` works for the owner). See `WORKFLOW.md` for the two-developer plus AI-assistant flow.

**As of 2026-08-07, `IOSapp` is a direct clone of this repo, at its root - there is no longer a separate `IOSapp/Riftline/` working copy.** That two-tree setup (this repo plus a working copy on a different remote, manually kept "identical" - which it in fact was not; see the sessions below for exactly how they'd diverged) was retired at the user's request specifically because of that silent drift. If you're reading this from `IOSapp` and it still looks like it has a `Riftline/` subfolder or an `X-in-a-bottle` remote, something regressed - it shouldn't.

## Current state (2026-08-11)

**Latest - single-stair asymmetric second-floor combat platform, awaiting Robert's Blender approval:** Concourse layout V12 replaces the rejected long two-stair overlook with one narrow front-left entrance that widens into a central combat platform and narrows again at the rear. Each team has exactly one wide straight stair with closed trapezoid side walls, thick sloped handrails and a flush landing. A 25-degree full-height blast wall sits fully inside the deck and blocks the stair-to-core sightline; its inner-left side remains glass-free so players can deliberately jump to the unchanged flat concourse floor. Only the nuclear-objective-facing inner edge uses ballistic glass over a continuous metal base. The opposite edge uses grounded metal parapets, and the chest-high equipment box is offset toward the glass so the broad outer route remains open. There is no second stair, symmetric straight bridge, repeated gate pylon, roof, lower ramp or suspended support. Floor one, the circular outer wall and the right-side buildings were preserved from the clean V10 source.

The gameplay contract is 134 solids / 134 static bodies, `RiftlineMapLayout.VERSION` is 12, and `RiftlineNetwork.PROTOCOL_VERSION` is 23. The ten merged material roles remain unchanged; the shell is 49,592 triangles. The authoritative local files are `art/maps/concourse_v2_access_redesign.blend` (623,315 bytes) and `assets/maps/concourse_v2_environment.glb` (3,370,884 bytes). The immediately preceding V11 file is recoverable at `/tmp/concourse_v2_before_one_stair_platform_redesign.blend`, and `/tmp/concourse_v2_before_reference_detail_pass.blend` remains the clean V10 rebuild base.

Blender MCP authored and visually inspected the new mirrored platform, and a separate Blender 5.1.1 background process reopened the compressed source with exactly ten mesh objects. Godot MCP reimported the `.blend` and `.glb`; independent headless import is clean; all 19 exercises pass. Player-sized physics probes climb the sole stair, traverse the outer route around both covers, jump through the unguarded opening and land on a flat floor normal. The desktop preview reports 120 FPS, 11 draw calls, 49,704 primitives and 0.008818 seconds process time. This remains local and intentionally unpushed until Robert approves it in Blender. No phone or tablet was launched or deployed, and no mobile GPU, thermal, battery or touch-feel claim is made.

**Latest - reference-detail overlook pass without the overhead wall:** Concourse layout V11 keeps the V10 continuous, traversable deck but replaces its greybox presentation with a layered industrial treatment matching the supplied reference: segmented ballistic-glass frames and clamps, recessed outer-rail panels, double deck fascia, floor plate joints, route dashes, threshold grating, grounded tapered gate pylons, inset panels and restrained amber/white/lime lighting. The rejected overhead gate wall/header is absent from both the Blender shell and Godot collision, so neither players nor shots meet invisible geometry. RED and BLUE remain exact 180-degree mirrors.

The gameplay contract is now 132 solids / 132 static bodies, `RiftlineMapLayout.VERSION` is 11, and `RiftlineNetwork.PROTOCOL_VERSION` is 22. The ten merged material roles remain unchanged; no texture, imported mesh, new material role, shadow caster, light node, camera or frame callback was added. The shell is 30,680 triangles. The authoritative files are `art/maps/concourse_v2_access_redesign.blend` (437,219 bytes) and `assets/maps/concourse_v2_environment.glb` (2,113,776 bytes); the recoverable pre-pass source is `/tmp/concourse_v2_before_reference_detail_pass.blend`.

Blender MCP and a direct independent Blender background reopen both validate the compressed source at ten mesh objects. Godot MCP reimported both assets, all 19 exercises pass, and the live preview reports 120 FPS, 11 draw calls, 30,792 primitives and 0.008682 seconds process time on the desktop review scene. No phone or tablet was launched or deployed; no mobile GPU, touch-feel, thermal or battery result is claimed.

**Latest - template-faithful connected overlooks:** Concourse layout V10 supersedes the rejected V9 dogleg. Each team overlook is now one continuous, watertight Blender deck with a modest outer-edge turn, one perfectly straight and level ballistic-glass line facing the nuclear objective, one freestanding waist-high equipment box, a grounded far portal and an open outer safety rail. Both stair tops meet the deck at their near-level final rise; every portal and rail upright begins on the deck, and the equipment box has clear walking space on all sides. RED and BLUE remain exact 180-degree mirrors.

The gameplay contract is 134 solids / 134 static bodies, `RiftlineMapLayout.VERSION` is 10, and `RiftlineNetwork.PROTOCOL_VERSION` is 21. The source remains ten merged material roles with no new texture, shader, material role, light, camera or frame callback. The shell is 24,568 triangles. The authoritative files are `art/maps/concourse_v2_access_redesign.blend` (359,925 bytes) and `assets/maps/concourse_v2_environment.glb` (1,640,924 bytes); the recoverable pre-correction source is `/tmp/concourse_v2_before_template_connection_fix.blend`.

A follow-up Blender-only correction fixes the two angled outer-rail spans on each overlook. Their Godot collision rotations were already correct, but the earlier Godot-to-Blender angle conversion pointed the visible top and base beams across the opposite diagonal, making them protrude beyond the deck. All eight affected beam components now follow the shallow deck edge and remain exact RED/BLUE mirrors. The pre-fix source is `/tmp/concourse_v2_before_outer_rail_alignment_fix.blend`. Independent import, the map exercise and the visual exercise pass; the gameplay contract and protocol remain unchanged.

The V9 traversal evidence below was invalid for stair continuity: its passage probe teleported directly onto the second floor, so it could pass while the stair still stopped against the platform side. V10 starts the passage probe on the arena floor and physically walks up the first stair, around the isolated equipment box, through the portal and to the opposite stair landing. Separate probes also climb all four mirrored stairs beyond local X=22.4. Independent import is clean, all 19 exercises pass without `SCRIPT ERROR`, visual coverage includes every gameplay solid, and live Godot review confirms the transparent straight glass and stair/deck contact. The headless 4v4 CPU sample still prints `frames=120 avg_ms=16.67 min_ms=16.67 max_ms=16.67`; as before, its non-exiting process was stopped by the watchdog after the sample. A clean live desktop run logged only the benign physics-interpolation warning caused by the temporary MCP review camera. No phone/iPad launch, deployment, mobile GPU, touch-feel, thermal or battery test was performed.

**Latest - narrow dogleg ballistic-glass overlooks:** Concourse layout V9 replaces each 12 m-wide straight overlook slab with two 8 m-wide spans meeting at a shallow 9.462-degree centre turn. The route centre shifts outward by 2 m and back again, producing the requested small corner without compromising either stair landing. The rejected 3.6 m-high diagonal divider is completely removed. The core-facing ballistic glass, open outer safety rail, single waist-high equipment box and far portal all follow the new angle; RED and BLUE remain exact 180-degree mirrors.

The gameplay contract is 130 solids / 130 static bodies, `RiftlineMapLayout.VERSION` is 9, and `RiftlineNetwork.PROTOCOL_VERSION` is 20. The source remains ten merged material roles with no new texture, shader, material role, light, camera or frame callback. The shell is 24,888 triangles. The authoritative files are `art/maps/concourse_v2_access_redesign.blend` (364,469 bytes) and `assets/maps/concourse_v2_environment.glb` (1,662,432 bytes); the recoverable pre-edit source is `/tmp/concourse_v2_before_narrow_dogleg.blend`.

Validation: Blender MCP rebuilt and visually inspected both mirrored overlook regions; Godot MCP reimported both assets, ran the main scene, and captured a live game view showing the narrow turn, glass and removed divider. All 19 exercise scripts pass, including player-sized probes that climb both stairs, follow the dogleg, pass the equipment box and leave by the opposite stair. Visual coverage passes for every gameplay solid. The headless 4v4 CPU sample remains `frames=120 avg_ms=16.67 min_ms=16.67 max_ms=16.67`; the live desktop game process reported 241 draw calls, 39,692 primitives and 118 FPS. No phone/iPad launch, deployment, mobile GPU, touch-feel, thermal or battery test was performed.

**Latest - screenshot-authoritative ballistic-glass overlooks:** Concourse layout V8 replaces the V7 staggered slalom on both second-floor overlooks with the exact composition requested in the user's final reference: one broad elevated deck, two end stair approaches, one tall angled divider, exactly one waist-high equipment box, a wide framed far portal, a low/open outer rail, and a segmented ballistic-glass wall along the inner edge facing the nuclear-objective zone. RED and BLUE are exact 180-degree rotational mirrors. The deck's high edge now meets the existing ramp at local X=22, so collision and visible access agree.

The gameplay contract is 126 solids / 126 static bodies, `RiftlineMapLayout.VERSION` is 8, and `RiftlineNetwork.PROTOCOL_VERSION` is 19. `GLASS_Ballistic` is the tenth imported mesh role and binds to a cached transparent `StandardMaterial3D` at alpha 0.26; the corresponding continuous thin collision wall blocks players and shots while preserving a view into the objective zone. The authoritative files are `art/maps/concourse_v2_access_redesign.blend` (359,102 bytes) and `assets/maps/concourse_v2_environment.glb` (1,284,696 bytes). The recoverable pre-edit source is `/tmp/concourse_v2_before_reference_fidelity_fix.blend`.

Validation: clean independent Godot import; all 19 exercise scripts pass; the Concourse visual exercise confirms authored coverage for all 126 gameplay solids and exactly 24,480 imported triangles; and the headless 4v4 CPU sample remains `frames=120 avg_ms=16.67 min_ms=16.67 max_ms=16.67`. Live Godot MCP loaded the main scene, confirmed the ballistic-glass material and alpha, and returned a desktop game-process snapshot of 241 draw calls, 39,172 primitives and 115 FPS. Blender MCP and a live Godot runtime view were visually inspected. No phone/iPad launch, deployment, mobile GPU, touch-feel, thermal or battery test was performed.

**Latest - reference-style open second-floor platforms:** Concourse layout V7 replaces both teams' boxed overlook corridors with rotationally mirrored open combat decks based on the user's reference image. The two stair landings and the existing centre-facing cover remain, while the former full-height outer wall becomes a low industrial safety rail. Each deck now has one offset 3.6 m-high divider, two staggered 1.4 m-high cover blocks, and a 7.2 m-clear portal at the far landing. The alternating path around the cover is deliberate and has been traversed by a player-sized physics probe in both team orientations.

The gameplay contract is 132 solids / 132 static bodies and `RiftlineNetwork.PROTOCOL_VERSION` is 18. The rebuilt Blender region preserves the existing nine merged material roles, uses no textures or new draw-call role, and reduces the authored shell from 25,992 to 24,120 triangles. The authoritative files are `art/maps/concourse_v2_access_redesign.blend` (352,244 bytes) and `assets/maps/concourse_v2_environment.glb` (1,611,644 bytes). The recoverable pre-redesign source is `/tmp/concourse_v2_access_before_reference_overlook.blend`.

Validation: clean independent Godot import; all 19 exercise scripts pass; the Concourse visual exercise covers every layout solid with authored geometry; and the 4v4 headless CPU sample remains `frames=120 avg_ms=16.67 min_ms=16.67 max_ms=16.67`. Live Godot MCP loaded 132 gameplay solids plus the visual wrapper and reported all 26 mirrored overlook nodes at their V7 transforms. Blender MCP and a Godot cinematic preview were both visually inspected. The edit adds only static collision and merged geometry: no `_process`, physics-tick, light, camera, shader or material-role work. No phone/iPad launch or deployment, mobile GPU, touch-feel, thermal or battery test was performed.

**Latest - symmetric centre-facing overlook cover:** Concourse layout V6 adds one player-height wall to the centre-facing edge of each team's elevated overlook. Each wall is 1.2 m thick, 1.8 m high and 8.0 m long at team-local `(22, 4.1, 26)`, joining the existing low parapets without extending into either stair mouth. The previously unequal north inner parapet is now an exact 4.0 m mirror of the south parapet; both sides leave the same 1.75 m clear gap before the nearest stair edge. RED and BLUE remain rotational mirrors of one another.

The gameplay contract is now 128 solids / 128 static bodies and `RiftlineNetwork.PROTOCOL_VERSION` is 17. The authoritative Blender source and exported GLB carry the same mirrored cover and trim within the existing nine material-role meshes; no texture, imported mesh, material role, light or runtime node was added. The shell is 25,992 triangles. Recoverable Blender backups are `/tmp/concourse_v2_access_before_center_cover.blend` and `/tmp/concourse_v2_access_before_parapet_symmetry.blend`.

Validation: clean Godot reimport; all 19 exercise scripts pass; live Godot MCP confirmed both named centre-cover nodes and all four matching inner parapets at their authored transforms. Blender MCP confirmed the corrected source at 25,992 triangles and visually verified matching left/right geometry. The 4v4 headless CPU sample printed `frames=120 avg_ms=16.67 min_ms=16.67 max_ms=16.67`; the watchdog later stopped the non-exiting game process, so this remains CPU-only evidence rather than a device performance result. No iPhone/iPad launch, deployment, human touch, thermal or battery test was performed.

**Latest - open bridge and overlook passages, ready on PR #24:** Concourse layout V5 retains the mirrored floor-to-central-bridge ramps and the fully open straight bridge from V4, and now corrects both teams' elevated overlook passages. Each former full-span cross-baffle is split into two 3 m cover wings with a clear 4 m doorway between them. The cover and industrial panel/light language remain, but a player capsule can walk directly between both stair landings. The Blender source and exported GLB carry the same openings, so no visible wall disagrees with collision.

The gameplay contract is 126 solids / 126 static bodies and the nine-role shell is 25,824 imported triangles. `RiftlineNetwork.PROTOCOL_VERSION` is 16 so layout-V5 clients cannot silently predict against an older blocked passage. The old diagonal elevated connectors and central blocker remain deleted, the straight bridge supports remain below deck, and the obsolete upper AI route remains on the open east ground flank. The authoritative Blender working source is `art/maps/concourse_v2_access_redesign.blend`; the original Blender-5.2-authored `art/maps/concourse_v2.blend` remains preserved.

Validation: clean Godot reimport; all 19 exercises pass; player-sized probes climb all four overlook stairs, cross both mirrored upper passages, climb both central access ramps and cross the full straight bridge; and visual coverage confirms every collision solid is represented by authored geometry. A live main-scene `Actor_host` driven only by normal `move_forward` crossed one complete upper passage from `(27.5, 4.1, 14.0)` to `(27.5, 3.20, 39.68)`. The 4v4 headless CPU sample remains `frames=120 avg_ms=16.67 min_ms=16.67 max_ms=16.67`. The only runtime warnings were benign physics-interpolation warnings caused by MCP test-position teleports outside the physics tick. No iPhone/iPad launch, deployment, thermal, battery or touch-feel test was performed for this correction.

**Latest - L4 Concourse blueprint visual correction, accepted, on device, not yet merged:** the authored shell is now generated directly from `RiftlineMapLayout`'s 129 collision solids, so visible geometry and collision cannot disagree.
The previous build had 129 collision bodies with zero visible meshes, because `RiftlineMap` only builds greybox meshes when the GLB fails to load; every collidable surface was an invisible wall.
`tools/riftline_map_visual_exercise.gd` now fails the build if any gameplay solid has no authored geometry over it.

The second root cause was material: the old shell painted 11,752 of its 18,484 triangles of authored panel work at a **1.06:1** luminance ratio against their own background, and `clean_surface` hard-set `AO = 1.0`, so a fully modelled facility rendered as flat grey.
`shaders/nuclear_pbr.gdshader` gained an analytic pattern set (floor plates, wall panels with bolts, scratched steel, grate slots, hazard striping, light housings, concrete), restored material AO, and hemisphere plus contact-darkening terms that give geometry its form back without shadows.
`shaders/nuclear_sky.gdshader` is a new analytic night sky - stars, one galactic band, warm horizon lift, no green.

The shell carries **nine** roles, not eight: the blueprint's lighting sheet separates OBJECTIVE FOCUS lime from LANDMARK LIGHTING lime, and one shared role let decorative inserts out-mass the reactor inside its own arena.

Collision fixes: `OverlookInnerParapetNorth` walled off 2.25m of a 4.5m ramp exit; the `overlook` waypoint sat 0.47m off the connector behind a rail; the outer-wall plinth kerb protruded 0.64m past collision. Solid count stays 129.

**Measurement correction - read this before trusting older numbers.** `editor_manage(monitors_get)` reports the *editor* process, not the running game; hiding the entire map shell does not move its reading. The 320/327/328 draw-call figures recorded in earlier sessions were never measuring the game. Measured inside the running game by toggling shell visibility: **the map shell costs 9 draw calls and 27,568 primitives, and a player-height pose totals 219 draw calls** against the 320 target. The earlier "renderer budget failure" was an artefact.

Validation: headless import clean, all 19 exercises pass, 129 solids / 129 static bodies, shell 9 meshes with 0 shadow casters and 0 colliders, mobile renderer, both lights shadowless, headless CPU `frames=120 avg_ms=16.67 min_ms=16.67 max_ms=16.67`, live traversal to the upper deck on all four ramps.
Five bounded read-only visual reviews ran (the `frontend-visual-reviewer` at Opus stood in for Sol and Terra, which are not agent types in this harness); the preflight was FAIL on all fourteen criteria and acceptance was withheld four times before returning PASS.
Deployed, launched and process-verified on the paired iPad. No human visual, thermal, battery or long-session confirmation is claimed, and headless never measures GPU cost.

Open and deliberately not actioned: signage and facility numbering are sparse; accent-lime inserts are solid slabs where the trim sheet shows dashed; the open-topped disc leaves a dark upper frame at player height, which needs a product decision.

**Latest - upper-route and blueprint fidelity correction remains a candidate:** the ramp collision wedge now rises along local +X, matching the route markers and the visible Blender ramps, so the player can traverse from the lower approach to the overlook deck without changing the 129-solid collision contract.
The final live traversal reached `Vector3(30.92, 3.20, 14.0)` from `Vector3(10.0, 0.04, 14.0)` in the main scene.
The authored shell now uses neutral gunmetal, dark tactical floor, amber maintenance guidance, and lime objective or vertical-access accents, with no persistent red or blue environment identity.
The Blender source and GLB include bounded non-colliding ramp edge guides, lime landing posts, a reactor plinth and cage, portal frames, cover caps, and four large `03` bay signs.
The current GLB contract is exactly 8 role meshes, one surface per role, 18,484 imported triangles, and the expected bounds remain enforced by `tools/riftline_map_visual_exercise.gd`.
The frozen layout exercise still reports 129 solids.
All `tools/*_exercise.gd` scripts pass after the latest GLB import and the headless import check passes.
The headless CPU sample remains `frames=120 avg_ms=16.67 min_ms=16.67 max_ms=16.67`.
Live Godot MCP reports the mobile renderer, 327 draw calls, 29,234 primitives, 145 FPS, approximately `0.002398` seconds process time, and approximately `0.000048` seconds physics time.
All eight imported role meshes report `cast_shadow=0`.
The current live draw-call reading is above the recorded 320-call budget target, so performance signoff is not claimed.
Sol Medium recommended the material, palette, ramp, lighting, signage, and bounded detail recipe that drove these changes.
The final Terra High review still returned `FAIL` or `PARTIAL`, with the remaining problems concentrated in player-height corridor identity, cover silhouette variation, base/transit readability, signage visibility, and ramp destination readability.
There is no reported conflict with frozen collision, routes, scale, shadowless rendering, or mobile constraints.
L4 remains not accepted, no commit was created, and the latest candidate has now been redeployed to the iPad.

The deployment used the explicit iPad UDID `78C9B3A4-2E79-5827-A287-5F09C7E29ACA` because the script's no-argument device discovery is iPhone-only.
The corrected export and Xcode build succeeded, the app installed at `file:///private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/E6939E92-573E-4BF6-B386-45BD1D3C60D2/SOGS.app/`, and `xcrun devicectl device process launch` started `com.lull.riftline`.
`xcrun devicectl device info processes` verified the running `SOGS` binary at PID `2701`.
This confirms installation and process launch only; no human visual, performance, thermal, or battery confirmation on the iPad is claimed.

**Latest - explicit new-map iOS deployment correction, installed and launched:** on 2026-08-09, `RiftlineMap` was changed to preload `res://scenes/concourse_v2_visual.tscn` for presentation builds so the authored Concourse shell cannot silently fall back to the old procedural map during device startup.
The deployment script now selects the newest exact `SOGS.app` output by modification time instead of relying on a five-minute filesystem filter and `head -1`.
The headless import check passed, the Concourse V2 visual exercise passed, and live Godot MCP main-scene inspection found `RiftlineMap/ConcourseV2Visual/ImportedEnvironment` with the authored shell present.
The corrected iOS export and Xcode build succeeded, producing a 29,123,244-byte `SOGS.pck` with the current map asset scan included.
The first install attempt failed because the device disconnected immediately after CoreDevice connected, but the corrected package was subsequently installed successfully at `file:///private/var/containers/Bundle/Application/B9ECCB95-AAD6-44F8-9F6D-337F8D96F6B9/SOGS.app/`.
The app launched successfully as `com.lull.riftline`, and `devicectl device info processes` verified the running binary at PID `2666`.
The map has not yet received a human visual confirmation on the iPad, and no on-device performance or thermal result is claimed.
L4 remains not accepted and no commit was created.

**Latest - L4 blueprint-authoritative Concourse visual shell candidate, not accepted:** the user clarified that the visual layout may diverge from the old original map and must follow the supplied blueprint composition, textures, and style language while retaining no persistent red or blue faction coloring.
The current visual shell is a loadable candidate, not an L4 completion, because the latest read-only Terra review returned `NOT FAITHFUL`.
The macro layout now reads as a circular facility with eight radial lane plates, a top-down concentric raised ring, repeated cover clusters, four heavy neutral gateways, larger neutral numeral plates, outer modular ribs, and a tall open reactor cage.
The remaining Terra failures are fixable visual deficiencies in cover silhouette variation, gateway landmark weight, geometric panel/trim/grate/conduit language, amber maintenance hierarchy, and player-height ring readability, not frozen collision or route conflicts.
The frozen 129-solid gameplay collision and routes were not changed.
The latest sources are [concourse_v2.blend](/Users/willis/Documents/IOSapp/art/maps/concourse_v2.blend), [concourse_v2_environment.glb](/Users/willis/Documents/IOSapp/assets/maps/concourse_v2_environment.glb), [concourse_v2_visual.gd](/Users/willis/Documents/IOSapp/scripts/concourse_v2_visual.gd), and [L4-BLUEPRINT-EVIDENCE-2026-08-08.md](/Users/willis/Documents/IOSapp/handoffs/L4-BLUEPRINT-EVIDENCE-2026-08-08.md).
Blender MCP confirms exactly 8 mesh objects, 0 non-mesh objects, one surface per role, and 15,364 triangles.
The GLB is 834,204 bytes, the imported bounds are `AABB(Vector3(-60.0,-1.0,-60.0), Vector3(120.0,8.2,120.0))`, and the six runtime material variants remain clean, neutral, shadowless, texture-free, and no-grime.
The latest Godot MCP live capture run is `r22959500-38`, with oblique overview, top-down overview, four cardinal player-height views, center player view, and elevated view recorded in the evidence manifest.
Fresh headless import passed, all 19 exercise scripts passed, and the CPU sample remained `frames=120 avg_ms=16.67 min_ms=16.67 max_ms=16.67`.
Live Godot MCP monitors report 328 draw calls and 24,917 primitives at 145 FPS, so the 320 draw-call ceiling remains an unresolved renderer-budget failure.
No on-device thermal, battery, GPU, or long-session verification was performed.
Do not commit or report L4 complete until Terra accepts the blueprint fidelity and the draw-call budget is reconciled.

**Latest - L3 Concourse V2 visual integration and performance verification:** the shipping presentation now instantiates exactly one `ConcourseV2Visual` wrapper over the frozen 129-solid gameplay collision, and procedural greybox meshes are suppressed whenever the imported GLB wrapper loads successfully.
`scripts/concourse_v2_visual.gd` binds all eight authoritative mesh prefixes to cached `NuclearMaterials.clean_surface` variants, rejects unknown prefixes, and forces every imported `GeometryInstance3D` to `SHADOW_CASTING_SETTING_OFF` without any per-frame callback.
`NuclearMaterials.clean_surface` uses the existing `nuclear_pbr` shader with a cache-keyed clean branch that preserves albedo, metallic, roughness, specular, and emission while skipping relief noise, grime, dust, and material AO work.
The arena now uses bright uniform color ambient as the dominant diffuse source, retains the sky for reflection, and explicitly disables shadows on its directional and omni lights.
The procedural map path also ignores legacy `casts_shadow` values at runtime and forces every map mesh shadowless.
The final visual exercise covers the exact wrapper root and asset child, all eight prefixes, 14,020 imported triangles, eight one-surface meshes, cached material reuse, clean-path parameters, no collision/camera/light/environment nodes, no frame callbacks, and shadowless uniform lighting.
The final map and material exercises plus the headless import check passed, and the full suite contains 18 passing exercise scripts.
Godot MCP 3.1.2 and Blender MCP both passed their required live gates before investigation, with Blender MCP confirming the eight Concourse mesh prefixes, 14,020 triangles, eight material slots, and no image-texture nodes.
Live Godot MCP inspection confirmed eight imported runtime mesh children, zero map shadow casters, two world lights with shadows disabled, 4v4 actor count of 8, and route AI states exposing center, maintenance, and overlook lanes.
Representative live core states were forced through `game_eval` at center, ground carry, upper carry, RED install, and BLUE install, with the visible core remaining present at each authored position.
Live screenshots were inspected at the base, center approach, maintenance route, overlook deck, and bridge/core approach for bright readable surfaces, clean hard-surface response, and no visible cast shadows.
The headless full-squad CPU sample remained `frames=120 avg_ms=16.67 min_ms=16.67 max_ms=16.67`; this is CPU-only and does not measure mobile GPU cost.
Matched windowed MCP monitor samples were stable at 320 draw calls, approximately 26,088-26,170 primitives, 145 FPS, and approximately 0.000088 seconds of physics processing across base, center, and overlook poses.
The prior L1 record was 308 draw calls, so the integrated visual build is 12 draw calls above that recorded comparison and is not yet a clean renderer-baseline pass.
No on-device iPhone or iPad thermal, battery, GPU, or long-session frame-pacing verification was performed for L3, and the 320-versus-308 renderer delta needs a follow-up optimization or matched baseline audit before shipping signoff.
The pre-existing untracked `art/maps/concourse_v2.blend.import` remains untouched, and Godot-generated `.uid` files were allowed to exist for the new scripts.

**Latest - L1 Competitive Concourse V2 gameplay blockout:** the old heuristic Concourse map was replaced with an immutable `RiftlineMapLayout` version 2 contract and explicit collision solids, mirrored RED/BLUE bases, center, maintenance, and overlook route graphs.
`RiftlineMap` keeps its public arena API, builds collision without meshes when presentation is disabled, loads `res://scenes/concourse_v2_visual.tscn` once when available, and uses a procedural greybox fallback with one logged error while that visual scene is still missing.
The map has 129 authored collision solids, includes the 40-segment circular shell, frozen central bridge and blocker, symmetric base interiors, maintenance corridors, overlook decks, ramps, upper connectors, launch pads, gates, and spawn pockets.
Ambient decorative motion is removed; objective pulsing is the only event-driven processing and is disabled while inactive.
Bot roles now map Runner to center, Escort to maintenance, Defender to center, and Raider to overlook, with carriers and Escorts preferring the maintenance return route.
Lane changes invalidate cached bot waypoints, and `ai_state()` exposes the active lane.

Verification for this session is complete: the Godot MCP 3.1.2 editor connection was live for runtime inspection, live screenshots were checked at center, base, east flank, and upper-overlook poses, and live route state reported zero ambient motion and inactive map processing outside a pulse.
The headless import check passed, all 18 `tools/*_exercise.gd` scripts passed, and the direct 4v4 arena performance sample remained `avg_ms=16.67`, `min_ms=16.67`, `max_ms=16.67` over 120 frames.
The required serial runner command returned an empty capture again, so the direct Godot binary result is the recorded performance evidence rather than pretending the runner emitted a sample.
Windowed MCP renderer monitors stayed at 308 draw calls and 145 FPS across samples, with physics process around `0.000041-0.000072` seconds and process around `0.001674-0.001759` seconds.
The separate visual-scene import remains outside this map scope.
The uncommitted build was nevertheless exported, signed, installed, launched, and process-verified on the connected iPad Pro 12.9 (5th generation) through `devicectl` as `com.lull.riftline`.
No human touch or thermal playtest was performed by the agent, but the user subsequently played the completed L1 blockout on iPad and approved it for commit.
Detailed temperature, battery, and long-session frame-pacing measurements were not separately reported and remain open for the final integrated build.
The coordinator's later correction excludes all weapon, sniper, HUD, recoil, damage-feedback, and viewmodel requests from L1; none of those files were edited here.

**Latest - L2 Optimized Blender environment shell:** Blender MCP authored and exported `art/maps/concourse_v2.blend` and `assets/maps/concourse_v2_environment.glb` without changing gameplay, collision, or the L3 visual integration files.
The shell preserves the frozen Concourse V2 dimensions and route landmarks while adding merged, non-colliding environmental detail for bases, maintenance, overlook, ramps, connectors, bridge, and the central objective area.
The final Blender source contains exactly 8 mesh objects, 8 material-role meshes, 14,020 triangles, 8 materials, one material slot and one surface per mesh, applied transforms, no non-mesh objects, no image texture nodes, and no mesh-prefix violations.
The source bounds are `[-60.1, -60.1, -1.0]` to `[60.1, 60.1, 7.2]`, the exported GLB is 792,452 bytes, and red plus blue identity and indicator roles cover 0.1296% of measured mesh surface area.
The generated Godot import reports `AABB(position=(-60.1, -1.0, -60.1), size=(120.2, 8.2, 120.2))`.
The art-only preview is `scenes/concourse_v2_art_preview.tscn`, with one imported environment, one camera, one shadowless key light, one world environment, and no post-processing or extra render camera.
Godot MCP live inspection found 15 preview nodes, 8 imported mesh children, unit scale, one surface per mesh, `cast_shadow=0` on every imported mesh, and no runtime errors.
The final preview screenshot showed the complete circular shell and the distinct base, maintenance, overlook, bridge, and central structures after the Blender material readability pass.
The Godot MCP preview monitor sample reported 286 draw calls, 11,198 primitives, and 0.00005 seconds of physics processing.
The current live main-scene comparison also reported 286 draw calls, but the preview monitor's MCP FPS and object counts are not treated as device performance evidence.
The headless import check passed and all 18 `tools/*_exercise.gd` scripts passed.
The required serial arena performance command returned an empty capture, and the direct Godot binary did not emit a fresh sample before a bounded stop, so no new L2 CPU performance number is claimed.
Headless validation cannot establish mobile GPU cost, and no human iPad thermal, battery, or long-session frame-pacing check was performed for this isolated art preview.
L3 still owns the shipping wrapper and material integration in `scripts/concourse_v2_visual.gd` and `scenes/concourse_v2_visual.tscn`, including any final `NuclearMaterials.clean_surface` policy decision.

**Agent tooling hard gate:** every implementation, debugging, review, test, or verification task that touches game behavior must prove a live `godot-ai` MCP editor-plugin connection with an actual successful tool call before substantive investigation or any repository write.
Godot CLI and headless checks remain complementary validation and are never a fallback for missing MCP.
Any Blender or 3D-model task likewise requires an actual successful Blender MCP call, and a Blender-authored game asset requires both Blender MCP for source work and Godot MCP for import and live-game verification.
Planning, documentation-only edits, and Git or PR administration that do not assess game behavior are exempt.
See `AGENTS.md` section 0 for the blocking rules.

**Same day, second performance round - sniper scope rebuilt as FOV zoom, not picture-in-picture (`/sonnet-opus`, Opus-advised):** after the first round's throttle/MSAA fixes, the user reported the scope was still laggy on-device *and* now looked "chunky, lower resolution" while scoped - a real regression from disabling AA on the picture-in-picture SubViewport. `opus-advisor` (Medium) found the actual root cause was architectural, not tunable: the scope picture was drawn at up to 86% of screen height from a 512px source (a ~2.75-4.4x upscale), so no AA setting could have made it look sharp, and a second full-scene render at close to main-view resolution was never going to be cheap regardless of throttling. The picture-in-picture camera/SubViewport is removed entirely; the sniper now zooms the *main* camera's own FOV, exactly like every other weapon's ADS already does (`RiftWeapons.ads_horizontal_fov()`) - zero extra render passes, full native resolution, existing MSAA intact. The HUD's tube/vignette 2D art is unchanged in look but now masks the whole screen (not just its own footprint) since the zoomed view is the real main view, visible everywhere until masked. Also found and fixed a real bug from the first round: the HUD's redraw-gate rewrite (below) was itself defeated by an unconditional per-tick scope-texture push, meaning the "only redraw on change" fix never actually took effect during any match. Added magnification-aware ADS look-sensitivity scaling (only for the sniper - other weapons' already-tuned feel is untouched), since a flat sensitivity multiplier at the sniper's 3x/6x zoom would have felt wildly twitchy now that player look input actually reaches the zoomed camera (it never did under picture-in-picture). Verified live via MCP: both zoom stages render crisply full-mask-to-edges, at correct FOV, with no runtime errors. **Still not on-device verified** - same open item as below.
**Sixteenth session, mobile ADS button drag-look fixed (Robert):** mobile players can now hold the ADS button with the right thumb and drag that same touch to steer the camera while the left thumb keeps moving. The path already existed behind `ads_button_look`, but its default was OFF and previously saved device configs kept it OFF indefinitely. `DuelHud` now defaults it ON and carries a versioned one-time controls migration; a later explicit OFF choice remains respected. `riftline_mobile_touch_exercise.gd` now covers the full simultaneous two-thumb contract plus legacy/current config behavior. Clean import, all 18 exercises pass, and MCP live-game evaluation confirmed a same-touch ADS drag produced scaled look input with clean current-run game logs. The build was signed with Robert's Personal Team, installed, launched, and process-verified on both the connected iPhone and iPad. Human on-device feel/aim verification remains the next check; this input-event-only change adds no per-frame or physics-tick work.

**L2 session, Nuclear Rush respawn timing and carrier risk:** the frozen decision is a flat 6.0-second minimum in LIVE and SUDDEN_DEATH, independent of score, team, installed objective, carrier status, or dead-teammate count. Humans remain manual after the gate, bots auto-request at the same boundary, and `respawn_started` remains the authoritative spawn event. Non-vest carriers now take authoritative `RiftlineMatch.CORE_CARRY_DAMAGE_PER_SECOND` = 2.5 HP/s through `Duelist.take_damage()`, while the Runner's nuclear vest is immune; the existing 0.82x movement multiplier and independent 15-second dropped-core timer remain unchanged. `RiftlineNetwork.PROTOCOL_VERSION` is 13 with no wire-field changes. The design note predates source implementation in commit `803f109`; full implementation and validation evidence is appended to `devlogs/2026-08-08.md`.

**Fifteenth session, performance regression diagnosed and fixed (`/sonnet-opus`):** the fourteenth-session "super laggy" iPad report is addressed, not just filed. Measured with the existing `_arena_perf_sample` headless harness plus live MCP `game_eval` inspection (see `devlogs/2026-08-08.md` for the full numbers and method). The sniper scope's second full-scene render pass is throttled from `UPDATE_ALWAYS` (up to 120Hz) to `UPDATE_ONCE` on a 30Hz cadence (`scripts/duelist.gd`, `SCOPE_REFRESH_SECONDS`) - camera transform/recoil still update every frame, only the re-render itself is throttled. The bots' `route_toward()` pathfinding call, previously unconditional every physics tick for all seven bots, is now cached and recomputed on a jittered ~0.2s interval (`scripts/bot_duelist.gd`, `ROUTE_RECOMPUTE_SECONDS`) with an early-recompute trigger if the objective goal jumps more than 3m. High Alert's raycast was confirmed already correctly gated behind cheap early-outs and left unchanged. All three systems are kept, per the user's explicit instruction - nothing was reverted. **Not yet done: on-device (iPad) re-verification** - everything above was verified in-editor/headless, which is the same gap that let the original regression ship unmeasured. See "Performance discipline" below for the standing rule this added.

**Fourteenth-session context (superseded above):** three suspects were recorded with concrete file:line pointers and a bisection methodology in `handoffs/NEXT-SESSION-performance-regression.md`, now historical - its diagnosis was accurate and its fixes are in, but on-device confirmation is still open.

**Latest - fourteenth session, High Alert threat warning chip (Robert, PR #8):**
A universal local passive (no chip-selection UI yet, everyone gets it) that warns the local player when an enemy is aiming at them: alive, opposing team, 55%+ into ADS, within 95m, inside a 5.5-degree aim cone, outside the player's own view, and unobstructed - a pulsing edge arc/chevron plus a `HIGH ALERT` plate. Restyled onto the twelfth session's HUD token/plate system on merge (`HUD_ALERT`, `draw_plate`, `draw_tracked_centered`), same trigger logic and public contract. Full detail: "Fourteenth session" in `devlogs/2026-08-07.md`.

**Thirteenth session, objective-aware autonomous bots (Robert, PR #9):**
Offline teammates and enemies now understand Nuclear Rush instead of acting as combat-only targets. Each squad assigns deterministic Runner, Escort, Defender, and Raider roles; bots dynamically claim the core, escort a friendly carrier, intercept an enemy carrier, deliver and install at their own pad, defend a launch, or invade and cancel an enemy launch. They reuse the map's route planner, keep fighting opportunistically while moving toward the objective, recover from obstructions, and drive the same authoritative `interact` input used by players. A new end-to-end exercise covers decisions plus real pickup/install/cancel rules. Headless import is clean, all 17 exercises pass, and MCP runtime inspection confirmed the live 4v4 bots moving without game-log errors. Full detail: "Thirteenth session" in `devlogs/2026-08-07.md`.

**Twelfth session - full art/UI redesign via `/sonnet-opus`: Blender MCP weapons, HUD/UI visual pass, sniper scope picture-in-picture rework:**
The "zero imported art" constraint was explicitly retired this session (Blender-authored assets are now a normal part of the pipeline; Mobile renderer stays hard, unchanged). All five weapons plus the Shield-class revolver were rebuilt as Blender-authored `.glb` models in a Halo/Destiny register, replacing procedural geometry, materialized through `NuclearMaterials`/`nuclear_pbr` by the same mesh-name-prefix convention the character import already used. `duel_hud.gd`, `rift_link_panel.gd`, `riftline_main_menu.gd`, and `riftline_class_panel.gd` got a full consistent visual redesign, replacing the old placeholder look, with every public signature and touch hit-test region preserved (a real latent settings-panel hit-test bug found and fixed along the way). The sniper scope was reworked from a flat full-screen mask to a genuine picture-in-picture second camera, fixing both the "solid color outside the scope" and "no recoil while scoped" reports at once. Full detail: "Twelfth session" in `devlogs/2026-08-07.md`.

**Eleventh session - all seven bugs from `handoffs/NEXT-SESSION-weapon-visual-bugs.md` fixed, via `/sonnet-opus`:**
The reticle now tracks recoil (a new `Duelist.recoil_presentation()` pushed into `DuelHud` each frame, same pattern as `ads_progress`), the confirmed respawn-with-same-weapon bug is fixed (`set_weapon_presentation(force: bool)`), the sniper scope reticle kicks under recoil instead of reading as dead, the sniper reticle is a dot with ranging marks instead of a cross, the pistol is one-handed at hip and two-handed on ADS with a genuinely mirrored (not just relocated) support hand, the shield's default carry reads as in front of the character with a squared-up ADS parapet and a visible reload pose, and the shader's periodic sine-wave surface relief - the actual cause of the moving stripe artifact - is replaced with an analytic-derivative noise field. Full detail, including each fix's known remaining limitations (pistol sleeve occlusion, shield forearm-cuff ring, unverified long-range shader aliasing): "Eleventh session" in `devlogs/2026-08-07.md`. `handoffs/NEXT-SESSION-weapon-visual-bugs.md` is now historical - its diagnosis was accurate, but every bug it describes is fixed; nothing there is still open work.

**Ninth session - recoil, muzzle flash, ballistic shield rework, first-person hands (ported from the old `IOSapp/Riftline` working copy, now retired):**
Ported as a clean patch from that working copy's own sixth session - see "Ninth session" in `devlogs/2026-08-07.md` for full detail, and its "Known, pre-existing three-way divergence" note for exactly how the two trees had drifted apart before this port (this repo's own sixth-eighth sessions - Blender character, death-presentation cleanup, core-carry damage removal - were not reflected in the old working copy; conversely this session's work didn't exist here until ported). Recoil now moves the weapon rig's position, not just its rotation. Muzzle flash is a real crossed-blade star plus a brief point light. The Shield class has a reworked ADS (plate pitches into a low parapet, sidearm rises to a normal centered sight), a shield-bump melee, a reload pose tucked behind the vertical shield, a much larger vision port, and a new revolver model. First-person hands exist on this render path for the first time, team-neutral by design.

**Fifth session - weapon models, sights, sniper scope, and shield visibility redesign (via `/sonnet-opus`):**
All five weapon models rebuilt with distinct silhouettes; sights redesigned from a single occluding lens disc to real hollow sight housings (reflex sights, a ghost-ring shotgun sight, three-dot pistol notch-and-post) with matching HUD reticles that are now actually visible during ADS (previously none were, for any weapon). The sniper finally has a real scope: a vignette + mil-dot HUD overlay with two visibly distinct zoom stages, since a physically modeled scope tube can't be looked *through* in a raster render. Shield-class players can now see their own shield in first person - previously it only rendered for everyone else. Found and fixed a real bug along the way: 4 of 5 weapons' `optic_tip_local`/`ads_anchor` didn't actually satisfy the alignment invariant, so their sights sat visibly off the crosshair. Full detail, including a follow-up fix pass on the shotgun/pistol sights: "Fifth session" in `devlogs/2026-08-07.md`.

Robert's circular arena is in as the **only** map, ported forward from PR #1 rather than merged.
Nuclear Rush is the **only** mode, built to the final rules below.
The session layer is 4v4 on protocol 13 with no map or mode negotiation left in the wire format.
Art moved to real PBR via `shaders/nuclear_pbr.gdshader` + `NuclearMaterials`. The shipping character and the standalone Cover V2 review are now explicit user-requested Blender-import exceptions; neither uses textures.
The settings-panel touch-capture bug (a sliding finger activating other controls) is fixed with a regression test.
Headless import is clean and all 17 exercises pass.
Full detail: `devlogs/2026-08-07.md`.

**Same day, second session - multiplayer hardening and three bug fixes:**
- **Reconnect grace period.** A human actor's connection dropping during a LIVE/ARMING match no longer instantly abandons the match. The dropped slot is reserved under a rejoin token for `RiftlineLobby.RECONNECT_GRACE_MS` (20s); the same client reconnecting within that window is restored to its original actor/team identity. Only a grace-window timeout (or a non-live-phase disconnect, unchanged) abandons the match. New: `RiftlineRoster.disconnect_peer/reclaim/disconnected_records`, `RiftlineLobby.disconnect_peer/reclaim_peer/sweep_grace`, network-level rejoin handshake in `riftline_network.gd`. This is foundation work for eventual internet play (still LAN/ENet only today, by explicit user decision - see `devlogs/2026-08-07.md`), not internet play itself.
- **Health bar fixed.** `duel_hud.gd`'s vitality strip was rendering `ceili(health/20)` as 5 discrete plates (a "5 hits and you're dead" display) even though the underlying model was already a real 100 HP value. It is now a continuous 0-100 bar with a numeric readout.
- **Damage falloff/range bug fixed.** `rift_ballistics.gd`'s `M4_MAX_RANGE` was 48m on a 60m-radius (120m diameter) map - long-sightline shots were vanishing with zero damage and no feedback, which read as "shots not registering." Range raised to 95m with a real linear damage falloff (23 near, floors at 14 far) instead of a hard cutoff.
- **Bullet/impact visuals fixed.** The in-flight tracer was a thin box streak and the wall/duelist impact effect was a literal `+`-shaped cross (two crossed boxes). Tracer is now a small stretched sphere; impact is a circular scorch mark + ring, not a cross.
- **Settings panel redesigned + Main Menu added.** There was previously no way back to the connection/staging screen from inside a match short of restarting the app. `duel_hud.gd` settings now has a MAIN MENU action (reuses the existing `_on_rift_link_cancelled()` leave/severed path) and the whole panel moved from hand-placed pixel offsets to a real 2-column grid with section headers; the dead inert "QUICK SWAP" chip was removed.
- All 16 exercises still pass, including a new reconnect-grace block in `tools/riftline_lobby_exercise.gd`.

**Same day, third session - weapons, accuracy model, and class loadouts (`handoffs/NEXT-SESSION-weapons-and-loadouts.md`, now done):**
- Iron sights and the knife are gone. Every weapon ADS's through an optic; melee (`Duelist.melee_attack()`) swings whatever weapon is currently equipped, with per-weapon range/damage/cooldown.
- Five real weapons replace the single generic M4/PULSE: assault rifle, MP7-reference SMG, S1897-reference pump shotgun (9-pellet rosette), 9mm-class pistol, Halo-Infinite-referenced sniper (two zoom steps, zero ADS drift). New `scripts/rift_weapons.gd` data table backs all of it; `rift_ballistics.gd` is now fully data-driven.
- New accuracy model: `RiftWeapons.cone_for()` composes hipfire/ADS x stationary/moving/jumping/crouching from one formula per weapon, driven by new networked `Duelist` state (`bloom`, `shot_counter`, `ads_progress`) that is symmetric across `authoritative_state()`/`apply_presentation_state()`.
- Four classes (frontline/sniper/runner/shield) resolve into 1-2 loadout slots via `Duelist.configure_loadout()`; `RiftlineRoster` carries `player_class`/`primary_weapon` (defaults to Frontline/Rifle - no selection screen yet, see below). Runner wears the nuclear vest as visual class equipment and is immune to the restored authoritative 2.5 HP/s carry damage; non-vest carriers take that damage, and the shield still blocks frontal damage.
- All five weapons rebuilt on `NuclearMaterials` instead of the old flat `pulp_lit` boxes (mid-session user feedback: the old carbine read "Roblox/TF2-like," not the Halo/Destiny register the rest of the game already commits to) - still "lightly on the model side" per the handoff, not final art.
- `PROTOCOL_VERSION` bumped 10 -> 11 (new `melee` input field, renamed `melee_strike` wire event, new snapshot fields).
- All 16 exercises still pass, several extended for the new weapon/accuracy/loadout surface. Full detail: the "Third session" entry in `devlogs/2026-08-07.md`.
- **Not done:** shotgun reload is one bulk animation not shell-by-shell, no headshot hitboxes (none exist anywhere in the codebase yet, so the sniper's one-shot fantasy is only half-delivered), numbers are a first tuning pass. (Class selection UI landed the same day - see below.)

**Same day, fourth session - main menu, class picker, manual respawn, two bug fixes:**
- **Class picker** (new `scripts/riftline_class_panel.gd`), reused pre-game and on a new death screen.
- **Manual respawn.** `RiftlineMatch` no longer auto-respawns humans on a timer - `RESPAWN_MIN_SECONDS := 6.0` only unlocks `request_respawn()`, which the death screen's Respawn button calls explicitly. Bots request through the same authoritative gate. Non-host clients ride `respawn`/`class_id`/`primary_weapon` on the existing per-tick input frame. **Protocol bumped 12 -> 13 with no wire-field changes.**
- **Real main menu** (new `scripts/riftline_main_menu.gd`): CREATE GAME / JOIN GAME / ENTER DRILL, each into the class picker first. This is now the actual destination of the settings panel's MAIN MENU action, which previously went nowhere (`_on_rift_link_cancelled()` either did nothing or silently started a new offline match instead of showing any menu).
- **Health display bug fixed.** The offline path never synced `duel_hud.gd`'s `health` field outside the `damaged` signal, so a respawn (health silently reset to 100) left the HUD showing the stale 0 from the killing blow until the next hit. Now synced every tick, matching what the LAN path already did.
- **Optic visuals fixed.** ADS still read as iron sights because no weapon had anything resembling glass to look through. `Duelist._add_optic_lens()` places a glowing lens disc at each weapon's exact ADS calibration point.
- Found and fixed along the way: `_continuous_input()` in `riftline_arena.gd` never forwarded the `melee` field, so remote players' melee never worked over LAN (local-only). `project.godot` never registered a `melee` InputMap action despite it being read every tick - was throwing an engine error every physics frame.
- All 16 exercises still pass, plus a new respawn-gate block in `riftline_modes_exercise.gd`. Full detail: the "Fourth session" entry in `devlogs/2026-08-07.md`.
- **Not done:** drill squad-size selection (solo/wing/full) isn't reachable from the new main menu (ENTER DRILL goes straight to the real 4v4). No further main-menu/class-panel visual polish - still plain rects/text.

**Same day, fifth session - death cleanup and bot respawn:**
- Eliminated character visuals now keep the existing powered-down fall for 1.8 seconds, fade over 0.7 seconds, and then hide instead of remaining in the arena indefinitely. Respawning resets visibility, transparency, and the body pose.
- Bots now automatically call the existing authoritative respawn request when their same 6-second minimum death timer expires. Human players still use the death-screen button and can change class before respawning; that manual flow is unchanged.
- `tools/riftline_modes_exercise.gd` now covers both bot auto-respawn and death-visual cleanup/reset. Headless import is clean, all 16 exercises pass, and an MCP main-scene launch reports no runtime errors (existing GDScript warnings remain).

**Same day, sixth session - Blender Cover V2 preview (explicit imported-art exception):**
- User explicitly requested a Blender-authored map pass with more cover and varied interior-wall heights. The original uniform outer wall is unchanged; 32 new pieces span 1.10-2.55m and remain 180-degree symmetric for RED/BLUE fairness.
- The Blender source is `/Users/robertwu/Documents/New project/art/exports/RiftlineMap_Concourse_CoverV2.blend`. A visual-only 205-mesh export lives at `assets/maps/riftline_map_concourse_cover_v2.glb`, wrapped by `scenes/cover_v2_preview.tscn` with an orbit camera.
- This is a standalone review scene only: it has no gameplay collisions and does not replace the procedural shipping map. Press F6 while the preview scene is open; hold Space to pause its orbit.
- Godot 4.7.1 imported the GLB cleanly, the preview scene ran through MCP with no runtime errors, and the editor is left open on `cover_v2_preview.tscn`.

**Same day, seventh session - Blender character integrated into live play (explicit imported-art exception):**
- The old GDScript-built box/cylinder body silhouette is replaced by `assets/characters/riftline_duelist_lowpoly.glb`, a Blender-authored modular low-poly armored character: 31 meshes under seven named pivots (`Torso`, `Head`, left/right arms, left/right legs, root). The source is `/Users/robertwu/Documents/New project/art/exports/RiftlineDuelist_LowPoly.blend`; no textures are used.
- One shared model serves both teams. `Duelist` assigns RED/BLUE `NuclearMaterials` at runtime by exported mesh-name roles (`TEAM_`, `DARK_`, `ARMOR_`, `METAL_`, `VISOR_`, `ACCENT_`), so there are no SUN/VOID variants or duplicated team assets.
- Existing procedural gait, stance scaling, head pitch, strafe lean, class equipment, world weapon, carrier signal, collision capsule, and networking remain attached to the same `Duelist`. The 1.8s death hold + 0.7s fade now traverses all imported `MeshInstance3D` descendants; respawn restores visibility and zero transparency exactly as before.
- `riftline_modes_exercise.gd` now locks the imported model/pivot contract, minimum mesh count, both team albedos, death disappearance, and respawn restoration. Headless import is clean, all 16 exercises pass, and MCP live-game inspection confirmed 31 meshes and `nuclear_pbr` materials for both teams.

**Same day, eighth session - core carry health drain removed, later superseded by L2:**
- The earlier direct playtest decision removed the 2.5 HP/s non-Runner drain from client movement simulation, and that damage remains absent from `Duelist._simulate_motion()`.
- L2 restores the damage in the authoritative match tick only: non-vest carriers lose 2.5 HP/s, the Runner's nuclear vest is immune, and the 0.82x carrier movement multiplier remains.
- `riftline_modes_exercise.gd` now distinguishes client prediction from authoritative carry damage and covers both vest immunity and the normal death/drop/respawn chain.

**Same day, ninth session - High Alert chip v1:**
- Every local player currently has the High Alert chip equipped by default; there is no chip-selection screen yet. This is a presentation-only passive and does not change authority, damage, snapshots, or protocol 13.
- An enemy must be alive, on the opposing team, at least 55% into ADS, within 95m, aiming within a 5.5-degree cone, outside the local camera frustum, and have an unobstructed layer-1 sightline for 0.5 seconds. Cover blocks the warning; the chip never supplies through-wall information.
- A qualifying threat produces a pulsing amber screen-edge direction arc, `HIGH ALERT` plate, and a short procedural local warning tone. Each attacker must reacquire after losing the target, and its audio cue has a 5-second rearm window.
- New `scripts/riftline_high_alert.gd` owns the local evaluator. `tools/riftline_high_alert_exercise.gd` covers timing, aim cone/range, behind-camera direction, cover suppression, and HUD state. Headless import is clean, all 17 exercises pass, the visual preview was inspected at 1280x588, and an MCP live main-scene run has no runtime errors.

**Deferred by explicit user decision to their own sessions - do not start these inline, use the bootstrap files:**
- `handoffs/NEXT-SESSION-weapon-visual-bugs.md` - **done, see the eleventh session above.** Kept as a record of the diagnosis, not as open work. If a fresh visual pass on the same surfaces is wanted (the pistol-sleeve occlusion, the shield forearm-cuff ring, or long-range shader aliasing noted as remaining), file a new bootstrap rather than reopening this one.
- `handoffs/NEXT-SESSION-art-ui-redesign.md` - its character-material premise is now partly stale because the live character is a Blender import on `NuclearMaterials`; use it for further character polish and the still-unfinished full UI pass. Visual polish for the main menu/class panel belongs here too.
- `handoffs/NEXT-SESSION-respawn-logic.md` - respawn *timing* is now resolved (6s minimum + manual human respawn and automatic bot respawn). What's left there, if anything, is historical framing, not open base-mechanic work.

These touch `scripts/duelist.gd`, `scripts/riftline_arena.gd`, and `scripts/duel_hud.gd` in overlapping ways.
**Run them sequentially, one at a time, not as concurrently-running sessions against the same checkout** - see the "Sequencing" note in `NEXT-SESSION-art-ui-redesign.md` for what happens if you don't and how to do it safely with worktrees if you really want two running at once.

**Older backlog, still real but lower priority than the above:**
1. **Surface relief bands on large flat areas.** Drive albedo from the isotropic value noise and leave the sine sum for the normal only.
2. **Palette is over-saturated.** Team accents are on whole base walls; the pad emissive ring blows out. Large surfaces should be concrete/steel with team colour as accent only. (Likely absorbed into the art/UI redesign session rather than done separately - see that bootstrap file.)
3. **On-device touch playtest** of install/cancel, which PR #1's review asked for.

The old character `pulp_lit` gap is resolved by the Blender character integration above. UI polish and any later higher-detail character pass remain in the art/UI redesign bootstrap.

## THE GAME MODE - FINAL RULES

Nuclear Rush is the **only** mode.
Deathmatch and bomb defuse were removed and must not come back without a new recorded decision.
Full reasoning, plus every resolved implementation question, is in `handoffs/DESIGN-nuclear-rush.md`.
The rules themselves:

- **4v4.** One continuous 10-minute match. No round resets.
- **One nuclear core** spawns in the center of the map.
- Both teams fight for it and carry it back to their **own** launch base, not the enemy's.
- **Installing** the core at your own base pad begins a **launch countdown**. Install is a 2.5-second hold on `interact`.
- The **countdown is 25 seconds** and is visible to both teams.
- The opposing team can push into that base and **cancel** the launch with a 3-second hold on `interact`.
- A **successful launch scores exactly 1 point**. A cancelled launch scores nothing.
- **First to 3 points wins.**
- If nobody reaches 3 before the clock expires, the higher score wins.
- If the score is **tied** at expiry, the match enters **sudden death** and the **next successful launch wins**. Sudden death is unbounded, so there is no default winner and no coin flip.
- If the **carrier dies the core drops**, and either team can pick it up.
- A dropped core **untouched for 15 seconds returns to center**.
- After a launch or a cancel, the core **respawns at center after a short delay**.
- Carrying the core costs **0.82x movement speed**, and non-vest carriers take **2.5 HP/s** authoritative core damage. The Runner's nuclear vest is immune, and every carrier keeps their full loadout.
- Respawn delay is a flat **6.0 seconds**. Humans must explicitly request after the gate; bots request automatically.

Roles (Shield Operator, Core Carrier, Support Operator, Observer/Marksman) are playstyle labels only.
No loadout or perk restrictions are enforced.
High Alert is currently a universal v1 passive, not a selectable or class-restricted perk.

## The one map

There is exactly one map, the circular Concourse, and no map selection exists in the game.
It is Robert's layout from PR #1 on the Nuclear-Rush repo, ported forward onto current `main`: a 60m-radius circular floor, RED base north (+Z) and BLUE base south (-Z) with four spawn slots each, a central open core room, a symmetric oval of cover, raised midfield decks with ramps, and roofed flank underpasses.

## Art direction

Realistic, in the register of Halo Infinite (and, as of the twelfth session below, Destiny). **The "zero imported art" rule is retired as of 2026-08-07, by explicit user decision - Blender-authored assets are now a normal, ongoing part of the pipeline, not a one-off exception.** The Blender character and Cover V2 review were the first two cases of this; they are no longer exceptions to a rule, just the first examples of the rule.
Realism still comes from `shaders/nuclear_pbr.gdshader` plus the `NuclearMaterials` factory in `scripts/nuclear_materials.gd` for procedural surfaces: true metal-roughness response, procedural relief with an analytic normal gradient, grime in recesses, dust on upward faces, material-supplied AO, sky ambient and reflection, ACES tonemapping, soft shadows, bloom. Imported Blender meshes/materials sit alongside that toolkit wherever they serve the art direction better, and should still target the same PBR/mobile-lit look (bake down to `nuclear_pbr`-compatible materials or vertex data, not baked lightmaps or techniques the Mobile renderer can't afford).

**The renderer stays Mobile - this constraint is unchanged and still hard.**
SSAO, SSIL, SDFGI, SSR, and volumetric fog are Forward+ only and are not affordable at 120 Hz on a phone.
Do not reach for them.

## Performance discipline

**See `AGENTS.md` at the repo root for the full, current standing rules on this (performance measurement, clean-code discipline, and the `project.godot` editor bug) - it's the canonical reference for any agent working on this repo, kept in sync with what's below.**

The fourteenth session shipped a real regression (see the fifteenth-session note above and `devlogs/2026-08-08.md`) because four sessions in a row verified correctness only, never speed, despite the Mobile-renderer-at-120Hz constraint above already being a hard limit.
The user's standing instruction, as of the fifteenth session: **any session that adds or changes a system that runs every frame or every physics tick (a new camera/viewport, a per-actor loop, a physics query, a shader pass) must sample frame time before calling itself done, not just confirm it renders correctly.**
Use `_arena_perf_sample`/`--arena-perf-sample` (`scripts/riftline_arena.gd`) headlessly for a fast CPU-only relative check, and note in the session's devlog entry that headless mode never exercises the GPU - anything render/shader-cost-shaped (a second camera pass, a new material, more draw calls) needs either a windowed MCP run with `monitors_get`, or better, an actual on-device sample, since this project's own regression surfaced on-device and not in the editor. "It compiles and the exercises pass" is necessary but is no longer sufficient for anything with a per-frame or per-tick cost - say so explicitly in the devlog if a session skips this, don't let it go unstated the way the twelfth-fourteenth sessions did.

The older `shaders/pulp_lit.gdshader` is the previous illustrative look and is being retired in favour of `nuclear_pbr`.

Cover V2 is still preview-only (`scenes/cover_v2_preview.tscn`) and should not be treated as approval to replace the procedural shipping map without a separate decision - that's a gameplay/collision change, not an art one.

## Also decided, do not undo

- The **lean mechanic is gone** entirely: input, HUD controls, camera/gun/body tilt, network field. Do not re-add it.
- Teams are **RED / BLUE**, not SUN / VOID, including the rendered team colours.

## Tooling

- Godot binary on Robert's Mac: `/Users/robertwu/Desktop/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot` (Godot 4.7.1). Always export `GODOT_BIN=/Users/robertwu/Desktop/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot` on this machine. The older Downloads and `/opt/homebrew/bin/godot` paths no longer exist.
- Headless compile check: `GODOT_BIN='/Users/robertwu/Desktop/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot' GODOT_WATCHDOG_SECONDS=45 ./tools/run_godot_serial.sh --path . --headless --import`. An empty grep for `SCRIPT ERROR|Parse Error|Failed to load` means clean.
- Run one exercise: same runner with `--headless --script tools/<name>.gd`.
- Capture a PNG: same runner with `--resolution 2622x1206 -- --capture=/tmp/x.png --after=4`, then read the PNG to inspect it. **As of 2026-08-08, this fails in this environment** (`ERROR: Parameter "t" is null` / `Cannot call method 'save_png' on a null value` from `riftline_arena.gd`'s `_capture_after_delay()`) - confirmed pre-existing via `git stash` on an unmodified checkout, not caused by any session's changes. Headless mode's dummy rendering driver can't produce a real viewport texture to save here; use the windowed MCP `editor_screenshot(source="game")` path instead for visual verification, which does work.
- Deploy: `GODOT_BIN=/opt/homebrew/bin/godot bash deploy.sh <DEVICE_UUID>`. iPhone 15 Pro `47ED6F31-01BC-5659-832A-E0512FAF1031`, iPad Pro 12.9 `78C9B3A4-2E79-5827-A287-5F09C7E29ACA`.
- GDScript here is strict: untyped inference from a Variant is a compile error. Annotate when reading out of a Dictionary (`var d: Dictionary = ...`, `var f: float = ...`, `(x as Duelist)`).
- **`project.godot` text edits are unreliable in this environment - worse than "stale in-memory copy."** Confirmed 2026-08-08: opening or relaunching the Godot editor (including via the MCP session) after a direct text edit to `project.godot` can silently **drop an entire new section/key outright**, not just revert one value to something stale - reproduced repeatedly, independent of comment placement or formatting. Never leave the Godot editor open while working from the command line, and don't trust a `project.godot` text edit survived until you've verified it with a fully independent headless process (`ProjectSettings.get_setting(...)` via `--script`) taken *after* the editor has been closed and reopened at least once. **For anything performance- or behavior-critical, set it in script instead** (`Engine.physics_ticks_per_second`, `Viewport.scaling_3d_scale`/`scaling_3d_mode`, `SceneTree.physics_interpolation`, etc. are all real runtime properties - see `RiftlineArena._ready()` for the pattern) rather than fighting this. This is not a one-off fluke; treat every `project.godot` text edit as unverified until independently re-checked.
